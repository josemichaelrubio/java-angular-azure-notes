# P1

Your team lead reported to your manager that your first project worked well and that you are ready to take on a little more responsibility. This time, you will be tasked with creating a frontend for your application, refactoring your backend using Hibernate, and deploying your application. You will have two weeks to accomplish this task.

The quality of your project is a reflection of your skills and abilities, so I recommend that you create something you can be proud of.

Project presentations will take the place of one on ones on Monday April 5.
