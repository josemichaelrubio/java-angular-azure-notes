# Docker

- platform for developers to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers
- Docker can only be used on Linux machines (Docker Toolbox can be used to configure Docker on a Mac or Windows Pro)

## Containerization

### Virtual Machines vs Containers

- both ways we can have partition a single machine into multiple computing environments
- virtual machines each have their own OS that are integrated with the host machines host operating system with a hypervisor
- containers have the ability to share a an operating system while maintaining their own isolated computing environment
  - can have their own file systems, environment variables, etc.
- the hypervisor is not necessary, the guest OS are not necessary
- much more lightweight more easily scalable
- more efficient use of machine's resources

Containers are:

- Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
- Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
- Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
- Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
- Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
- Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

### Drawbacks of Containerization

- don't have the flexibility of using different operating systems for different applications ("OS lock in"); we can provide software which makes applications compatible with other OS but no longer have the benefit of them being as lightweight
- if host OS is compromised it effects all applications

## Docker Workflow

- image: the basis of a container

  - an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime

- two ways we can obtain an image
  1. we can build our image with a Dockerfile
  2. we can pull our image from DockerHub
- once we have an image we can create a container in that image

### Dockerfile

- A file which describes the the changes we're making on the environment to make our image

Dockerfile keywords:

- FROM: specifies the parent image, the image upon which your image is build on
  - if you don't include the FROM keyword, you're creating base image
- ADD: can do what copy does but can also use a URL
- COPY: copies a file or directory from the host to the container
- ENV: set environment variables
- EXPOSE: documents the port to be exposed (is not actually enforced, doesn't actually do anything)
- LABEL: allows you to set key value pairs of metadata
- WORKDIR: changes the working director from which changes are being made
- RUN: runs a shell command, or runs an executable

Building an Image with a Dockerfile

- this is done with the CLI build command, where the only required argument is the location of the Dockerfile
  - docker build .
  - docker build -t [tagname] .

### DockerHub

- centralized library for container images
- images available from software vendors, can add your own repositories

## Common Docker CLI Commands

> docker build .
> -t [tagname]
> -f [dockerfile name]

> docker run
> -d (detach terminal)
> -p [host]:[container] (publish to a port)

> docker image ls

> docker container ls

> docker stop

> docker pull

> docker push

## Docker Compose

- a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
- docker-compose.yml file allows you to configure your applications' services so that you can spin up all of your containers at once
